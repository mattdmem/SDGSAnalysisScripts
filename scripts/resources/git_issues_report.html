<h1>SDGSPipeline Quarterly Bug Report: {{ today }}</h1>

<p>This document is intended to help track trends in the amount of bugs reported by the bioinformatics team for the NGS pipeline.
    Bugs are recorded and unless urgent are fixed on the next pipeline release.
</p>

<p>Urgent bugs are those which are directly blocking patients being processed through the NGS pipeline and in general are resolved ASAP.  On the graph below Urgent bugs are those that have been closed.</p>
